The research aims (1) to implement TEG for self-sustaining environmental sensors to provide power; (2) measure the amount of energy being generated by heat coming from RPi as converted by TEG; (3) compute for the reliability of the system as implemented in the actual environment. (4) To create an IoT system that will measure smoke for possible forest fires and kaingin.
