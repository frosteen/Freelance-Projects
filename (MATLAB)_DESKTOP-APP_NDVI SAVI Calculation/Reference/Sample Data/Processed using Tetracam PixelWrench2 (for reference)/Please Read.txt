In the software PixelWrench2, these RAW files are imported and
then converted into Multipage TIF file (simply Multi-TIFF).

Multi-TIFF are overlayed TIF image conversions of those initially
RAW images. You can see individual TIF in the folder named 'Single TIF'.

This Multi-TIFF image was then false-colored, meaning the color bands
are shifted. From RGB to NRG. 

Lastly, NDVI was mapped and so the NDVI image was produced. 

NDVI = (NIR-R)/(NIR+R)

It really is easier to use the software because all you need to do is
just calibrate it. One click and you'll get the result. 

But the goal is to make a Matlab program that can also create NDVI and
SAVI map, and obtain vegetation indices (the values) per pixel, per 
image and per plant (that's why edge-detection is also needed).
