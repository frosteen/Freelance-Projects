The objective of the study is to develop a device that authenticates Philippine paper bills for the Blind using Image Processing. Specifically, the study aims: (1) to design a Philippine paper bill authenticator for the blind that detects level 1 and level 2 security features; (2) to utilize different algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network, Canny Edge detection, Hough Line Transform, Optical Character Recognition, and Gaussian mixture model that will detect the level 1and level 2 security features of Philippine currency; (3) to add an audio prompt element that can assist visually challenged individuals into the counterfeit detection; (4) utilizing confusion matrix to validate the accuracy and functionality of the device for each currency.
